# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Until 1.0.0, releases stay on 0.x: `Added` bumps minor, `Fixed`/`Changed` (and the other Keep a Changelog types) bump patch. The major version is never bumped automatically.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- CI (typecheck, build, unit and integration tests against Azurite, Docker build) and a manually triggered Release workflow that cuts this changelog into a version, bumps `package.json`, tags, publishes the image to GHCR and opens a GitHub Release.
